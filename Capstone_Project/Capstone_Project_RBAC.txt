Capstone Project - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a MERN Application

Project Description:
Design and implement fine-grained Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a MERN application where Admin, Editor, and Viewer roles govern which API actions and UI capabilities are allowed. Build a Node.js (Express) backend with JWT-based authentication that encodes role claims and enforces authorization via middleware and query-level filters in MongoDB. In React, reflect effective permissions by enabling/disabling controls, guarding routes, and hiding restricted data. Deliver seeded users/roles and demonstrate row-level ownership checks (e.g., Editors can modify their own content, Admins can manage all).

Hardware Requirements:
- Processor: Intel i5 or higher
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB
- Storage: 20 GB available
- OS: Windows / Linux / macOS

Software Requirements:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB Community Server
- React.js (v18)
- Express.js
- Visual Studio Code
- Postman for API testing

Key Features:
1. Authentication using JWT
2. Authorization Middleware (Role-based)
3. Ownership Check for Editors
4. Role-Based UI Rendering
5. Protected Routes for Admin, Editor, Viewer

Limitations & Future Scope:
- Token expiry requires manual re-login
- Static role definitions, no dynamic role management
- No hierarchical roles or audit logging
- No 2FA or refresh tokens yet implemented
- Future improvements include role inheritance, logging, OAuth integration, and enhanced UI/UX
