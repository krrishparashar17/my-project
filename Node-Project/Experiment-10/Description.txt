CLI Employee Management System Using Node.js

Objective:
Learn how to build an interactive command-line interface (CLI) application using Node.js that manages data in memory with arrays. This task strengthens your understanding of basic Node.js, user input handling, and array operations.

Task Description:
In this experiment, I created a simple Node.js CLI application that manages a list of employees stored in an array. The program allows the user to add a new employee (with name and ID), list all employees currently stored in memory, remove an employee by their ID, and exit the application. To achieve this, I used the readline module in Node.js to capture user input from the terminal and implemented a simple menu-driven system. All employee data is stored temporarily in an array and is lost once the program ends (no external database or file storage is used).

What I Did:
Designed a text-based menu for user interaction.
Implemented the "Add Employee" feature using array push().
Implemented the "List Employees" feature using forEach() to display employees with their IDs.
Implemented the "Remove Employee" feature using findIndex() and splice().
Handled invalid inputs and exit functionality gracefully.
Used template literals with emojis for a more user-friendly output.

Learning Outcomes:
Understood how to create an interactive CLI app using Node.js.
Learned how to use the readline module for capturing user input.
Practiced working with arrays in JavaScript (adding, listing, and removing elements).
