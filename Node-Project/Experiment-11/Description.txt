Title:
REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Objective:
To build a RESTful API using Express.js that manages a collection of playing cards. This experiment demonstrates routing, handling HTTP methods, validating input, and performing basic data manipulation in a Node.js backend environment.

Task Description:
In this experiment, an Express.js server is created that provides REST API endpoints to manage a playing card collection stored in an in-memory array. 
The API supports the following operations:
GET /cards → Retrieve all cards.
GET /cards/:id → Retrieve a specific card by its ID.
POST /cards → Add a new card (with suit and value).
DELETE /cards/:id → Remove a card by its ID.
The API validates card data (suit and value) before insertion, and returns meaningful JSON responses for both success and error cases. 
CORS is enabled for cross-origin requests.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Node.js
Express.js
CORS Middleware
REST Client in VS Code / Postman for testing

Conclusion:
This experiment helped in understanding how REST APIs work in Node.js using Express.js. 
It provided hands-on practice with handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE), routing, JSON request/response handling, and input validation.
