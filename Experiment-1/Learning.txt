1. Things I have Learned from the Experiment 1 of full stack:
I Learned how to write code for HTML language and learned about HTML tags.
I Learned how to create a student regestartion form with validation using elements like minlength,maxlength,title,etc.
I Understood use of proper input types such as text, email and number for the different segments of my HTML code.

2. Test Cases:
Name field only accepts 3 to 15 characters.
Email field only accepts valid email format.
Age field only allows numbers between 5 and 100.
If any required field is left empty, the form doesn't submit and shows an error.
Form submits successfully only when all fields are filled correctly.
