STUDENT REGISTRATION FORM - TEST CASES AND VALIDATIONS

1. FIELD: Name
- This field is required, the user must enter their name.
- The name should be between 3 to 15 characters long.
- It should contain only alphabets and spaces(though not restricted by pattern here).

VALID EXAMPLES:
- "Krrish"
- "John Smith"

INVALID EXAMPLES:
- "" (empty input) – will trigger required error.
- "Al" – too short.
- "JonathanChristopherSmith" – exceeds the 15 character limit.

2. FIELD: Email
- Must be filled in, it’s a required field.
- Should follow the proper email format like: krrish@gmail.com

VALID EXAMPLES:

- "test.user@domain.in"

INVALID EXAMPLES:

- "krrish@" – incomplete email.
- "krrish@domain,com" – invalid character used.

3. FIELD: Age
- This field is compulsory.
- It accepts only numbers.
- Valid age range is between 5 and 100.

VALID EXAMPLES:
- 5 – minimum limit.
- 20, 35, 90 – commonly valid ages.
- 100 – upper boundary.

INVALID EXAMPLES:
-"" (left blank)– gives required error.
-4 – too young, less than allowed.
-101 – more than max allowed.
-"abc" – letters are not allowed.

FORM SUBMISSION:
- The form will only be submitted if all inputs are correct.
- Even if one field is wrong, it won’t submit and will show error messages.

BASIC CSS LAYOUT (from assumed style.css):
- The form is centered and well-spaced.
- Inputs have proper spacing and are easy to interact with.
- A simple "Register" button is provided to submit the form.

WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS:
- I understood how to make a working student registration form using HTML.
- Learnt how to apply basic HTML validations like required, min, max, minlength, etc.
- Tried testing different kinds of input to check form behavior.
- Got clarity on how front-end validation works without JavaScript.
- Overall, this gave me hands-on practice in HTML forms and validation.
